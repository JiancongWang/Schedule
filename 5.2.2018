On going projects and critical resources needed.Projects ranked from time priority high to low

Brain project - 1
Next action: train a network for white matter lesion segmentation
Next next action: train a classifier on those intermediate output
Timeline estimate:
 I will try to do this before Andreas leaves, that's mid June.
Unmet Resources needed: 
 Need more GPU (a must)
 Need a radiologist to check the data. (Temperally Optional, but definitely needed for better publication sake). 
 Need permission to dig data in PACs. Set up the orthanc on brain cases (Temperally Optional, but definitely needed for 
 better project management sake).
Additional thought:
 Definitely interesting and worth doing. 
 I want to take the data digging part into my own hand as well. That way I almost have full control of the whole project 
 progress. 

Placenta project - 2
Next action: help Nadav find 2nd trimester cases and get those labelled
Next next action: help Ipek meet the reviewer's critique (maybe)
Unmet Resources needed:
 Funding to pay the chinese rad
Timeline estimate for next action:
 This one should be easy to do, 1~2 days on my side. The database is local and image total is only 300GB. Nadav has already 
 have the whole database backed up. I get full control of those data. 
Additional thought:
 Paul's latest comment for Ipek's rejected miccai paper here. 
 "Bummer about the bad reviews. I think it's challenging to get an application-of-CNN paper to do well in places like MICCAI 
 right now, just because of saturation and reviewer fatigue. My recommendation would be to prioritize a journal paper on 
 placenta segmentation for a more clinical audience. "
 I have to disagree. MICCAI paper on CNN is getting more and more innovative and practical each year.  
 For example last year a guy added a PCA shape constraint loss to CNN and get pretty good result on shape. We could apply that
 in this one as well to get better segmentation. 
 PCA shape. that's supposed to be Paul's expertise. In addition, both reviewer's request are standard in CNN paper. My 
 suggestion is, before complaining about the audience, we should do more literature review and try harder. 
 I think regular literature review is in urgent need for us. 
 
Lung project - 2
Next action: clean the 700 data David sent to XNAT and get them labelled
Next next action: train a detection network on LIDC + Kaggle + PennLung800(what I call our dataset for now).
Unmet Resources needed: 
 Labor power. (Optional)
 Drawing pad (Optional, but it will be nice to experiment on whether it improves efficiency or not. Going through
 150 brain cases has almost ruined my neck and wrist. )
Timeline estimate for next action:
 If I do it myself alone, probably takes anohter 2 week full time 14hr per day like the brains one did. 
Additional thought: 
 I think even in plain detection perspective, we have 800 more than LIDC and Kaggle. If we don't suck we 
 should be able to beat them in detection performance as well simply because we get more data. 

 Detection, drawing bounding box, is actually quite intricate work. A lot of detail to get right. 
 I need some time to really dig in the fasterRCNN and YOLO paper and code. May take a while. But it will be worth it. I will 
 start with a 2D example first just to get a hang of how to run those. 


PANTs - 3
Next action: finish the prototype and test it
Next next action: sit down with Nick, Paul, Long. Dig through the code and give an estimate how much effort need to spend
Unmet Resources needed: 
 None
Timeline estimate for next action: 
 Probably a week or two, with help from Nick. Without, probably a month or two. 
Additional thought:
 I think by now both you and Nick realize how powerful GPU is for this application. So we are all on the same page now and 
 that's good.
 Before I felt like either you guys or me or both are idiots when I was trying to preach GPU to you guys and you look at me 
 like some sort of nut head and enthuisast.
