Today is a good day! I just chatted with Andreas. He sorted a medical student who has bandwidth to help him segment the lesion.
Andreas will inspect the lesion segmentation quality himself. I will join the process as well unless you want me to do other 
stuff. I will try my best to do this in time and go dl route. The registration route, I and Long will talk to Nick about what 
we have right now.  

Also Andreas is filling in the missing mass effect and other feature himself. He said he will be able to finish it by the end 
of this week.
