Sunday report. I am done washing the diagnostic CT and biopsy CT. 
The biopsy CT is actually not 3D but 2D + time series. To extract the right time series one and reg it to 3D volume
is beyond reach in couple day. So I will do eyeball it manually. 

I am manually labeling nodule on diagnostic CT. 80 down, 30 to go. David sent me the correspondence of diagnostic CT to biopsy CT. 
Once I am done I am eye ball it. 

David found me a pre-trained Unet on lungCT for lung stripping. I suspect Nick use the same thing but whatever. I will based our classifier
on that. 

This will handle the the RSNA. But we still have 700 to go. I would seriously recommend you put this into your label facility to test list because
it is really labor intensive.
