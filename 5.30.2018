Weekly report for last week, 5.21.2018 - 5.28.2018
This week is not so productive. 
On Monday till Wednesday:
I was cleaning the brain mask and writing code for training. 
On Thursday:
I was reading R21 proposal writing stuff. 
Friday till Tuesday:
I was occupied by recreation activity mostly. Basically travelling with Guo in nearby places. 
Guo is leaving on 6.1.2018. Per his request I drove him to couple nearby places that he wanted to 
visit. 
I will work on weekend to compensate for this.
