Monday:
Writing some simple test for the patch generation and augmentation code. Fix some bugs discovered in the process. 
The code is clean now.  

Tuesday:
I am about to run the patch generation code and found an image that's upside down and another image that couple layer's label
is missing, very normal when you try to label high resolution ms images. 
So I checked and correct those. 

Wednesday, Thursday:
Generate patches, code up the optimizer part of the network. 

Read paper on YOLO 9000/YOLO v3 and Read paper on Focal loss/Retina Net. Both are state of the art bounding box detection paper. 
YOLO9000 uses hierachical softmax to combine coarse grain/finer grain classification label and use kmean to define bounding box
sizes and scale. Very reasonable stategy. 
Focal loss is basically a more aggressively decayed cross entropy that subject less to class imbalance. It is also quite easy 
to implement, so it is a good find. 

Friday:
Find that I forgot to skull strip the flair image. So figure out how to warp the brain map from T1 back to FLAIR. Run those. 
I know some affine transformation screw up due to either upside down image or orientation matrix mess up. 
So need to pick out those and re-run. 

Updated: I just done manually checking the brain map...There are around 30 images where the registration from flair to super 
resolution T1 screw up. So... we lose up to 1/6 accuracy even before down stream processing? 
I will fix those flair images and re-run the registration. 

Read a paper on DenseNet and two papers on weakly supervised learning, basically given only classification label one wants to 
give a rough segmentation as intermediate output and key is of course to make the segmentation as fine as possible. 
Very useful on large dataset with only categorical label.  


Saturday:
Doing pytorch tutorial. Pytorch is indeed much easier to write and use than tensorflow especially for newbie. For NLP there is 
not even comparison in terms of convenience. 

Sunday:
Continue doing pytorch tutorial and read code of fasterRCNN. Couple more functions to go.

Receive segmentation result on both chinese radiologists on 2 second trimester images that Nadav gave me
last week. I sent the segmentation to Nadav to take a look.
