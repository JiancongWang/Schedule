Weekly report for week 5.28.2018-6.3.2018

Monday- Tuesday, travelling with Guo
Wednesday - Thursday, checking warpped segmentation for the brain project, calculate the dice for the 
histogram based method
Friday - Saturday, dig the 500 case data for Nadav. 

Also I read 2 example of the R21. Now I have pretty good understanding the format, the content for the qualification 
exam.

Today both Nadav and Andreas's nvidia gpu grant will come. I will take those. Considering the one that Eduardo can get, 
we probably need to acquire one more workstation to house those. 

I will start testing different architecture for the brain project. Hopefully we will get a pretty good understanding on
what we are looking at this week.
