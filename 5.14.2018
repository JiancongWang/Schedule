Last Thursday and Friday:
Review how to parameterize an affine transformation. Code up the elastic transformation. 
Purpose: Now we have a working on-the-fly data augmentation code that can apply for both brain and lung project

I helped Eduardo draft up a gpu grant. Will follow up with him on this.  

HuZe updates the system and cuda version on the chinese cluster. I confirmed. Now it is up and fully usable. 

Saturday:
Code up the deepmedic network in Tensorflow. 
Purpose: Deepmedic comes in Theano. Theano is dead and its author already join google. So I decided to code up the 
network in Tensorflow. 

Monday: 
Continue coding up for deep medic. Implement a patch generator for deepmedic. 
Purpose: Deepmedic requires a low and high resolution patch to generate one segmentation. Just spend time to implement that. 

BTW Nadav told me the Nvidia gpu grant he applied is approved. It took roughly 2-3 week for it to come down.
