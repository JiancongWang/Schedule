Lung project:
Last Wednesday and Thursday, spent like 2 days on using VGG to extract feature + replicating a simplified YOLO detection head on a simple 
problem. Works now. Next should go for full YOLO/ faster RCNN for the lung project.

Brain project:
Friday and saturday, reading paper of from KK, the winner of Brats. He mentioned he use fully connected CRF for post processing.
So I dug out the CRF paper to read. Two years ago I didn't understand the fully connected CRF paper. Now I do in almost all 
details. 
Monday, done combining Michael (the medical student that Andreas sources)'s segmentation with my own. I am preparing data for 
trying deep medic/Unet on it. Start to read the code and try out Deep medic on it. 

Tuesday, Preparing code for data augmentation. I modified the code from spatial transformation network. Now we have a working 
differentiable trilinear interpolation written in native tensorflow. This helps a lot.
