Just done meeting with Eduardo. 

Eduardo and David are quite excited about possible publication. I am more worried about the 
winner of the Kaggle 2017. 
I wrote a summary of their solution. The cynical version is here. The winner, Liao, from his avatar you can see he is a cynical
geek. I like that because I am one as well. He is practically mocking the rest of the people in the competition.

They are, or he is, state of the art in both detection and classification. They achieved nodule classification malignant/benign 
of AUC 87% on test set. 
Their solution is very hardware heavy. Hell whose is not. If 8x TitanXp is what it takes, get it. 


Regarding Andreas project, yeah they made a mistake in collecting attending's feature extraction and miss couple important features
like mass effect. My short term suggestion is just stick to what we have. Fine tune it. This will at least give Andreas something
to publish in June.
But if Nick Brian the brain radiologist or you want to use the thing further, then give me the lesion segmentation + categorical 
extraction of those intermediate feature. Probably we can do with much less because this is 300rmb each for 3 repeated labelling in 
the estimate, but still it costs. 

I am working on fasterRCNN. This is a very important detection network that get used in a lot of nodule segmentation network
including the one in the Kaggle solution. so I want to write it once myself. It takes time but worth it. 

Also I realize I can't effectively practice CNN skills if the project we encounter is all like Andreas's and the lung one. I told
you the US doctor are shitty label source. Can't base my training on these guys. 
From industrial perspective it is unwise to pay the label just to practice. So I am going to practice on open CV problem, medical or
not. That I will report in the future report. I need to keep a healthy training and stay up with the trend and be competitive.
Otherwise couple cynical Chinese dude would take me and you out in the game easily. 

After I want to work on the nbody pointset registration. Get the IPMI publication as Paul suggests. I also want to train Long
to write CUDA so that he could convert the interpolation code that he uses a lot. After all he is the most heavy user of that
piece of code. He should take care of his own need.
